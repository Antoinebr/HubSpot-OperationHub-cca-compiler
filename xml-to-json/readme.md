# What does it do ? 

The idea of this Custom Coded Action is to parse an XML string into a JSON

## Dev

### Code the project in cca.js 

cca.js is where you write the code 

### Build

Build the project by running from the parent folder : 

```
npm run build name-of-the-folder

This will create a ```dist/``` folder inside your project
